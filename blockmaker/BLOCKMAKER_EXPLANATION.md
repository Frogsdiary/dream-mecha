# Blockmaker Module - Comprehensive Technical Explanation

## Overview

The Blockmaker module is a sophisticated grid-based pattern generation tool designed for creating complex geometric patterns ("sigils") that can be used in game systems, AI applications, and procedural content generation. It's built with PyQt5 and implements a unique adjacency-based placement system with multiple generation algorithms.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Grid System (`BlockmakerGrid`)

**Grid Specifications:**
- **Size**: 12x12 grid (144 total cells)
- **Cell Size**: 24x24 pixels (matches upgrade grid systems)
- **Coordinate System**: (row, col) tuples starting from top-left
- **Visual Style**: Gold blocks with black text, consistent with application theming

**Key Data Structures:**
```python
self.blocks = {}  # (row, col) -> block_number
self.valid_positions = set()  # Valid positions for next block
self.hover_pos = None  # Current hover position
self.dragging = False  # Track drag state
```

### 2. Adjacency Rules Engine

**Core Rule System:**
1. **First Block**: Can be placed anywhere on the grid, always numbered "1" (displays as "+")
2. **Subsequent Blocks**: Must be placed adjacent to existing blocks (up, down, left, right)
3. **Numbering System**: Sequential numbering starting from 1
4. **Validation**: Real-time calculation of valid placement positions

**Adjacency Algorithm:**
```python
def update_valid_positions(self):
    if not self.blocks:
        # First block: all positions valid
        for row in range(self.grid_size):
            for col in range(self.grid_size):
                self.valid_positions.add((row, col))
    else:
        # Subsequent blocks: only adjacent positions valid
        for pos in self.blocks.keys():
            row, col = pos
            for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # N, S, W, E
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= new_row < self.grid_size and 
                    0 <= new_col < self.grid_size and
                    (new_row, new_col) not in self.blocks):
                    self.valid_positions.add((new_row, new_col))
```

## Pattern Generation Algorithms

### 1. Random Pattern Generation

**Algorithm**: Simple random placement with adjacency enforcement
- Places blocks randomly in valid positions
- Respects adjacency rules
- Continues until target count or grid full

### 2. Stars Pattern Generation

**Complex Hybrid Algorithm** with multiple placement strategies:

**Strategy Distribution:**
- **40% Attraction**: Place adjacent to last block
- **40% Random**: Place anywhere valid
- **20% Mirroring**: Mirror from previous position

**Mirroring System:**
- **Directions**: North, South, East, West
- **80% Follow Rate**: High probability of following mirror rule
- **Fallback**: Random placement if mirrored position unavailable

**Key Features:**
- **Attraction Logic**: Creates connected clusters
- **Mirroring**: Creates symmetrical patterns
- **Random Elements**: Prevents predictable patterns
- **Adaptive Placement**: Handles edge cases gracefully

### 3. Glyph Pattern Generation

**Multi-Stage Algorithm** for creating complex symbolic patterns:

**Stage 1: Perimeter Filling**
- Fills entire grid border in clockwise order
- Creates frame for inner elements

**Stage 2: Inner Corner Placement**
- Places blocks at positions (1,1), (1,10), (10,1), (10,10)
- Creates anchor points for symmetry

**Stage 3: Symmetrical Ring Generation**
- Generates 2-4 concentric rings
- **Vertical Symmetry**: Mirrors left side to right
- **Randomization**: 10-25% chance to skip positions
- **Center Preservation**: Keeps center empty
- **Attachment Logic**: Optional connection to corner anchors

**Ring Properties:**
- **Radii**: 2 to (grid_size-1)/2
- **Symmetry**: Vertical mirroring across center
- **Density**: Controlled randomization
- **Center**: Always preserved as empty space

## User Interaction System

### 2. Visual Feedback System

**Block Rendering:**
- **Normal Blocks**: Gold background with black text

- **Text Formatting**: Monospace font, centered alignment
- **Special Display**: Block 1 shows as "+" symbol

**Position Indicators:**
- **Valid Positions**: Dashed gold borders
- **Hover Effect**: Semi-transparent gold overlay
- **Grid Lines**: Clean border system
