# Layout Mode "Squished" Parts Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**: Real-time Scaling During Drag/Resize

### **Root Cause**:
The `scaleContainerContent()` function was being called **during** resize operations, causing text elements to be scaled in real-time as you dragged the resize handles. This created a "squished" visual effect.

### **Additional Issues**:
- CSS transitions on `.layout-container` and `.corner-box` were causing visual lag
- Scaling was too aggressive (0.5x to 2x range)
- No threshold for preventing micro-adjustments

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Removed Real-time Scaling During Resize**
```javascript
// BEFORE (in handleResize):
this.scaleContainerContent(this.resizeElement, newWidth, newHeight);

// AFTER:
// Don't scale content during resize - only when resize ends
// This prevents the "squished" effect during dragging
```

### **2. Added Scaling Only on Resize End**
```javascript
// In stopResize():
const rect = this.resizeElement.getBoundingClientRect();
this.scaleContainerContent(this.resizeElement, rect.width, rect.height);
```

### **3. Made Scaling More Conservative**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const scaleX = Math.max(0.5, Math.min(2, newWidth / baseWidth));
const scaleY = Math.max(0.5, Math.min(2, newHeight / baseHeight));

// AFTER:
const scaleX = Math.max(0.7, Math.min(1.5, newWidth / baseWidth)); // More conservative
const scaleY = Math.max(0.7, Math.min(1.5, newHeight / baseHeight)); // More conservative
```

### **4. Added Threshold for Micro-adjustments**
```javascript
// Only apply scaling if the change is significant
const currentScale = parseFloat(container.dataset.currentScale || '1');
if (Math.abs(scale - currentScale) > 0.1) {
    // Apply scaling
}
```

### **5. Removed CSS Transitions**
```css
/* BEFORE: */
.layout-container {
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}
.corner-box {
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

/* AFTER: */
.layout-container {
    /* Removed transition to prevent visual lag during drag/resize */
}
.corner-box {
    /* Removed transition to prevent visual lag during drag/resize */
}
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix**:
- ❌ Parts get "squished" during drag/resize
- ❌ Text scales in real-time during operations
- ❌ Visual lag from CSS transitions
- ❌ Aggressive scaling (0.5x to 2x)

### **After Fix**:
- ✅ No "squished" effect during drag/resize
- ✅ Text only scales when resize operation ends
- ✅ Smooth, responsive drag/resize operations
- ✅ Conservative scaling (0.7x to 1.5x)
- ✅ Threshold prevents micro-adjustments

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Scaling Logic**:
1. **During Resize**: No scaling applied
2. **On Resize End**: Calculate final dimensions and apply scaling
3. **Threshold Check**: Only scale if change > 0.1
4. **Conservative Range**: 0.7x to 1.5x instead of 0.5x to 2x

### **CSS Improvements**:
- Removed `transition: all` from layout containers
- Removed `transition: all` from corner boxes
- Kept only necessary transitions (opacity, transform)

### **Performance Benefits**:
- No real-time text scaling during drag/resize
- Smoother visual feedback
- Reduced CPU usage during operations
- More predictable behavior

## 🎮 **How to Test**

1. **Enter Layout Mode**: Click "Layout Mode" button
2. **Select a Container**: Click any container to select it
3. **Resize Container**: Drag corner handles to resize
4. **Observe**: No "squished" effect during resize
5. **Check Result**: Text scales only when resize ends

The layout system should now feel much more responsive and predictable! 🎯
